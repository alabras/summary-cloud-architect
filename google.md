# Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Architect Specialization

## Google Cloud Fundamentals

### Core Infrastructure

#### Cloud computing overview
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits.
1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet
3. The cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool.
4. The resources are elastic
5. Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go.

Google believes that, in the future, every company—regardless of size or industry— will differentiate itself from its competitors through technology. Increasingly, that technology will be in the form of software. Great software is based on high-quality data. This means that every company is, or will eventually become, a data company


#### IaaS and PaaS

1. IaaS model, customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.
2. PaaS model, customers pay for the resources they actually use.

Serverless is yet another step in the evolution of cloud computing.
